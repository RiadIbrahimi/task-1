Hi Riad,

Ok here it is: We need a function that allows us to render EPL2 commands into a png file. (normally this would be sent to a Zebra Label Printer for printing)

Timeframe is: 2-3 days to implement this function, ready to deploy and tested.
Completion: no later than Wed. Feb. 14, 2018

We suggest the following approach:
Create a Laravel/Composer Package which is compatible with Laravel Lumen 5.4.
Package functionality: 
A singleton class as API with a function which gets 2 parameters: the EPL2 program code and the path to which the rendered image should be saved.
(Example: EPL2Renderer:: render ($epl2Code,"/tmp/label. png");)
The rendered image should be 600px wide and variable, depending on what the rendered content looks like (no texts cut off etc).
The goal should be that the rendered image looks as exact as possible as the label from the printer, i. e. use a similar font (you can find it on the Zebra page to download), etc....
Use the following package for barcode generation: https://github.com/picqer/php-barcode-generator with Type: TYPE_CODE_128.
The barcode type in the sample is EAN-13.

Attached are:
- EPL2_Manual
- sample Label images
- sample EPL2 codes to create these images

Please contact me any time if you have questions.
We would like to hear from you tomorrow or Monday with an update.

Best,
