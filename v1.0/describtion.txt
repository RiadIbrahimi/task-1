Hi Andreas,

About this project, I had never work with this ELP2 Syntax or something like this Zebra Printer.

When you sent me the project, I started researching about this.

Attached you have: 
Lumen Controller -> ELP2Controller.php
Lumen Model -> ELP2.php
Image -> image.png - which is created by ELP2 code in Controller.


Now the model read the code, create images from syntax code.

Now they are some bugs.

* Image padding.
* Image height.
* Image font size
* Image font style
* Numbers below the barcode

Can you run this, and send me comment about this and other steps, 
meanwhile I am trying to fix these...
